</p>

<p>评论不是为了一般的Q&amp;A。
评论应该围绕提高文档及服务器的建议进行。
对于如何使用Apache Tomcat的问题，应该去我们的
<a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/lists.html">邮件列表</a>。</p>

<p>如果评论包含或者被认为包含无效及关闭的话题，可能会被删除。
</p>

<section name="合规的用户">

<p>Verified users gain the Apache feather next to their name,
and may post comments with links in them without requiring approval
by a moderator before the comments are shown. Being a verified user
in itself does not give you moderating rights. If you are interested
in becoming a verified user, please contact us on the
<a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/lists.html#tomcat-users">users mailing list</a>.</p>

<p>All ASF committers are automatically verified users.</p>

</section>

<section name="Moderators">

<p>Moderators are allowed to mark comments as "Resolved", "Invalid"
or "Sticky", remove marks, approve comments e.g. if they contain
a link, and delete comments. Moderators can also subscribe to new
comments and comment updates and use the dashboard to gain some
overview over all comments of a site.</p>

<p>To use the moderation features, you need to login to the comments
system. Furthermore you will need to allow cookies to be set for
comments.apache.org (this is done using a secure https cookie). Once
logged in as a moderator you will see additional moderation
options attached to each comment.</p>

<p>If you are a long time follower of the Apache Tomcat projects
and you are interested in becoming a moderator, please contact us on the
<a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/lists.html#tomcat-users">users mailing list</a>.</p>

<section name="Privacy Policy">

<p>No data except what you personally submit is kept on record.
A cookie is used to keep track of moderators and other people
who wish to create an account to avoid having to enter their
credentials whenever they wish to post a comment.</p>

<p>To prevent spam and unsolicited comments, we use a digest of
visitors' IPs to keep track of comments posted by them.</p>

<p>Entering an email address when you post a comment is completely
optional, and will not be shared with anyone. If you enter an
email address, it will be used to notify you when someone posts
a reply to one of your comments, provided you have registered
an account and validated your email address.</p>
